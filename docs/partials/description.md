The `auro-dropdown` component is a trigger and dropdown element combination intended to be used with dropdown content that is interactive. `auro-dropdown` is content agnostic and any valid HTML can be placed in either the trigger or the dropdown.


_Note: if the dropdown content in your implementation is not interactive (e.g. a tooltip) [auro-popover](http://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/popover) may better serve your needs._
